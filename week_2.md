> Hello everyone this is Steve, and  
thank you for watching my demo video for the individual final project.  
For this, I have decided upon project 4: reproducing serverless data engineering arhitecture shown in Noah’s videos,  
and extending that design to other AI applications, including NLP.

### Steve Depp

**Individual project selection: Project 4**

-	Reproduce the architecture of the example serverless data engineering project
-	Enhance the project by extendng the functionality of the NLP analysis

> I chose this project firstly because it is highly levered to serverless architecture thats key to cloud services from all providers.
Also, this project incorporates many of the most prominent AWS services.
I like this project because ...   
it has hooks for other cloud services, ...  
its open to a domain application, ...   
and because it invites competitive comparisons with other providers such as GCP and Azure.

### Why project 4?**

-	Highly levered on lambda functions
-	Incorporates many AWS services
-	Many branches for a domain application

#

> As for extensions, I am not sure what domain extension I would employ, if any, but I am very eager to compare AWS, GCP and Azure service offerings and this project may be a way to do that.  I might also look to hang one of the other projects off project 4, e.g. the Flask app from project 1. 
So presently a lot is undefined, but looking ahead to the next 10 weeks ...

### Extensions to project 4

-	Domain extension
-	GCP and Azure
-	Integrating an additional project, e.g. project 1’s Flask app

#

> ... there are milestones, some of which probably serve as tickets for each of the next 8 demo videos.  
I want to keep this real and focus on real costs of owning this solution whether across a domain application or in comparison to GCP and Azure.   
I want to have CICD in place with a final release that is repeatable and automated.

### Milestones

-	Review reference materials
-	Replicate architecture 
-	CICD, monitoring, etc
-	Budget TCO
-	Nominate extended features + TCO
-	Investigate GCP and Azure architectures + TCO
-	Research & nominate domain application
-	Hooks for project 1
-	Development release
-	Production release

#

> There needs to be code deliverables each week, but in the end a hand off memordandum makes the project independent of developers so a customer can move to their next issue. 

### Project objectives

-	Weekly deliverables
-	Documented in Github
-	Source code in GitHub
-	CI/CD from AWS, GCP, Azure, Circle CI
-	Monitoring 
-	Handoff memorandum

#

> For success, each deliverable should be production quality.  That includes versioned code and the readme in GitHub and each of these 10 demo videos. 

### Success criteria 

-	DV production standard
-	GitHub professional quality
-	Handoff memoration 
		Presents the project
		Enables 100% client handoff
-	Cohesive quality
		Source code
		Architecture 
		Functionality 
-	MVP checklist
		Application 
		Separate development / production environments
		Comprehensive monitoring and alerts
		Correct Datastore
		Principle of least security enforced
		Data encryption in transit

### Deliverables

-	Completed production release in 10 weeks
-	Portfolio of 10 DV 
-	Handoff memorandum
