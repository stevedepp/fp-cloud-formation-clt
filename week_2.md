> Hello everyone this is Steve.  
Thank you for watching my demo video for the individual final project.  
For this I have decided upon project 4: reproducing serverless data engineering arhitecture shown in Noah’s videos  
and extending that design to other AI applications, including NLP.

**Steve Depp

**Individual project selection: Project 4**

-	Reproduce the architecture of the example serverless data engineering project
-	Enhance the project by extendng the functionality of the NLP analysis

> I chose this project firstly because it is highly levered to serverless architecture thats key to cloud services from all providers.
Also, this project incorporates many of the most prominent AWS services.
I like this project because ...   
it has hooks for other cloud services, ...  
its open to a domain application, ...   
and because it invites competitive comparisons with other providers such as GCP and Azure

**Why project 4?**

-	Highly levered on lambda functions
-	Incorporates many AWS services
-	Many branches for a domain application
